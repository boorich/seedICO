# seedICO
*A Framework for company building on the Ethereum Virtual machine.*

SeedICO is an open framework for teams or individual developers who would like to deploy a SeedICO token generation event with ease.

The framework aims at providing functions to cater for most of the standard considerations when setting up a structure that mimics a real-world company within smart contracts. That being said, SeedICO needs to be used with special care to the jurisdiction it is deployed under. Make sure to consult your legal advisory before deployment.

Furthermore the SeedICO can be used to fund open issues and automate payments for developers based on Gitcoin.

# who benefits from SeedICO
* Software developers who want to focus on their product rather than setting up crypto-based crowd funding campaigns on
* Project developers interested in launching projects at speed
* People interested in putting cryptoeconomic funds at the isoquant of productivity

# long term goal of the project
In a nutshell, the idea is to bring visions alive by embedding open value creation into any project right from the start. We believe that many great products never get their fair chance of being executed, because they just were not lucky enough to reside close enough to resources in the first place.

Therefore SeedICO will be a launchpad for your visions every step at a time.
